This test is to verify that the 3rd heading element will trigger the creation
of a new implicit/implied section with the 3rd HCE as its heading.

In this specific case, the new implied section must be added as a new
subsection (h2-C) to the first previous section that has a higher rank (h1-A).

Note that sibling sections (h3, h2) don't necessarily have the same rank.
