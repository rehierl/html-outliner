This test is to verify that the 2nd heading element will trigger the creation
of an implicit/implied section with the 2nd HCE as its heading.

In this specific case, the new implied section must be added to the body's
outline as there is no previous section with a heading of a higher rank.

Note - The sections of an outline (h2, h1) are not required to have the same
rank.
