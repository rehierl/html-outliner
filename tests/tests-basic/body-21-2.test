This test is to verify that the 2nd heading element will trigger the creation
of an implicit/implied section with the 2nd HCE as its heading.

In this specific case, the new implied section must be added to the body's
outline as there is no previous section with a heading of a higher rank.

The difference to "body-21-1.test" is the "usePerformanceShortcuts" setting
which allows to skip going up the chain of previous sections by testing the
current outline's last section if the rank of its heading is lower or equal
to the rank of the current heading.
