This basic test is to check the behavior when entering and exiting an SR
element. Note that the body element contains an implicit #text node.

An implicit text node will also appear in case of:

<body>
</body>

So it looks like implicit text nodes will appear if a start/end tag won't appear
right next to another start/end tag. That is, there will be #text nodes, if
there are characters in between those tags; even if those characters are
whitespace characters.
