This test is to verify the basic behavior when using a body element as
starting node.

Note - The body element contains an implicit #text node. The body element
will also contain an implicit #text node in case of "<body> </body>".

So it looks like implicit text nodes will appear if a start/end tag won't
appear right next to another start/end tag. That is, there will be #text
nodes if, and only if, there are characters in between those tags; even
if those characters are whitespace characters.
