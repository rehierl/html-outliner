In the future, the outliner will be able to handle hidden root nodes by simply
returning a null value as the resulting outline object.

For debugging purposes, hidden root nodes are not allowed. This is to verify
that there are no other circumstances in which a null value would be returned.

Note that the body element contains an implicit #text node.
