This test is to verify the basic behavior when using a hidden body element as
starting node.

In the future, the outliner will be able to handle hidden starting nodes by
simply returning a null value as the resulting outline object.

For debugging purposes, hidden root nodes are not allowed; i.e. these will cause
an error. This is to verify that there are no other circumstances in which a
null value will be returned.
